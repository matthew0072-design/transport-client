          Hence, our belief is that our growth from two buses to two thousand
          buses in fourteen years without 
          any outside help is made possible by God who for His own reasons chose
          to use us for this miracle. 
          We are the David of our time. Peace Group has combined staff strength
          of 2,750. Our presence is in about 19 states, thus, Our
          ebullient and astute Chairman, Chief Samuel Maduka Onyishi, was
          recently  decorated with the award of Member of Order of the
          Niger (MON) by the President and CIC of the 
          Federal Republic of Nigeria which in our opinion, is in recognition of
          the positive impact of our 
          company in the economic growth of our country.  To God be the
          Glory Peace Group Nigeria started from a humble beginning back in 1994
